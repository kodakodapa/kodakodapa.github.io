Welcome to my blog for learning.

## About This Blog

Here I inted to post writings every once in a while, mainly as a tool for my own learning, about tech and working in/with tech. I don't expect anyone to read it except the occasional CV evaluator (hi!).

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The color scheme uses the popular Solarized Light.



## What's Next?

Some writings about APIs.
