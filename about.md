## About 

Working in tech for a decade and a half. Currently a tech lead for medium sized platform, but soon I intend to return to tech consulting after a parental leave (starting Q3-26).

Having an LLM as a helper when learning and coding has made it fun and feasible to get some decent progress done in the small amount of time that I have as a father of two lively girls.

Currently doing a computer graphics renderer using GPUs, focused on fractals, in Kotlin. Cause it's fun and I want to learn Kotlin. Also some other personal projects. 

I intend to write something short about 3 times a month. [Github](https://github.com/kodakodapa)
